# TicTacToe

Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) for more information and game rules.

This game was created following the tutorial at [codequizzes](https://codequizzes.wordpress.com/2013/10/25/creating-a-tic-tac-toe-game-with-ruby/). This is a project for [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) Ruby track. See [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop?ref=lc-pb) for more information.
